## PART 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle 

### How I Think about Credit and Debt
Credit is the giving of buying power. This buying power is granted in exchange for a promise to pay it back, which is debt.

The downside risks of having a significant amount of debt depends a lot on the willingness and the ability of policy makers to spread out the losses arising from bad debts. Whether policy makers can do this depends on two factors: 

1. Whether the debt is denominated in the currency that they control and 

2. whether they have influence over how creditors and debtors behave with each other.

Two main long-term problems that emerge from these kinds of debt cycles are:
1. The losses arising from the expected debt service payments not being made.
2. The reduction of lending and the spending it was financing going forward.

The biggest risks are not from the debts themselves but from 

a. the failure of policy makers to do the right things, due to a lack of knowledge and/or lack of authority, and 

b. the political consequences of making adjustments that hurt some people in the process of helping others. 

Four types of levers that policy makers can pull to bring debt and debt service levels down relative to the income and cash flow levels that are required to service them:
1. Austerity (i.e., spending less)
2. Debt defaults/restructurings
3. The central bank "printing money" and making purchases (or providing guarantees)
4. Transfers of money and credit from those who have more than they need to those who have less

The key to creating a "beautiful deleveraging" (a reduction in debt/income ratios accompanied by acceptable inflation and growth rates) lies in striking the right balance betweeen them.

### The Template for the Archetypal Long-Term/Big Debt Cycle

For clarity, I divided the affected countries into two groups:
1. Those that didn't have much of their debt denominated in foreign currency and that didn't experience inflationary depressions, and 
2. those that had a significant amount of their debt denominated in foreign currency and did experience inflationary depressions.
Since there was about a 75% correlation between the amounts of their foreign debts and the amounts of inflation that they experienced (which is not surprising, since having a lot of their debts denominated in foreign currency was a cause of their depressions being inflationary), it made sense to group those that had more foreign currency debt with those that had inflationary depressions.

### Our Examination of the Cycle 

Money serves two purposes: 
- it is a medium of exchange and 
- a store hold of wealth.

Because it has two purposes, it serves two masters: 
1. those who want to obtain it for "life's necessities," usually by working for it, and 
2. those who have stored wealth tied to its value.

#### deflationary and inflationary depressions
- In deflationary depressions, policy makers respond to the initial economic contraction by lowering interest rates. It typically occur in countries where most of the unsustainable debt was financed domestically in local currency, so that the eventual debt bust produces forced selling and defaults, but not a currency or a balance of payments problem.
- Inflationary depressions clasically occur in countries that are reliant on foreign capital flows and so have built up a significant amount of debt denominated in foreign currency that can't be monetized (i.e., bought by money printed by the central bank).

### The Phases of the Classical Deflationary Debt Cycle

1. The Early Part of the Cycle
2. The Bubble
Eventually the debt service payments become >= the amount debtors can borrow, and the debts (i.e., the promises to deliver money) become too large in relation to the amount of money in existence there is to give. When promises to deliver money (i.e., debt) can't rise any more relative to the money and credit coming in, the process works in reverse and deleveraging begins.
- The Start of a Bubble: The Bull Market
Bubbles usually start as over-extrapolations of justified bull markets.
- The Role of Monetary Policy
The lenders and the speculators make a lot of fast, easy money, which reinforces the bubble by increasing the speculators' equity, giving them the collateral they need to secure new loans.

During such times, most people think the assets are a fabulous treasure to own -- and consider anyone who doesn't own them to be missing out. As a result of this dynamic, all sorts of entities build up long positions. Large asset-liability mismatches increase in the forms of a. borrowing short-term to lend long-term, 2. taking on liquid liabilities to invest in illiquid assets, and 3. investing in riskier debt or other risky assets with money borrowed from others, and/or 4. borrowing in one currency and lending in another, all to pick up a perceived spread.

- Spotting Bubbles
To identify a big debt crisis before it occurs, I look at all the big markets and see which, if any, are in bubbles. Then I look at what's connected to them that would be affected when they pop. The most defining characteristics of bubbles that can be measured are:
    1. Prices are high relative to traditional measures
    2. Prices are discounting future rapid price appreciation from these high levels
    3. There is broad bullish sentiment
    4. Purchases are being financed by high leverage
    5. Buyers have made exceptionally extended forward purchases (e.g., built inventory, contracted for supplies, etc.) to speculate or to protect themselves against future price gains
    6. New buyers (i.e., those who weren't previously in the market) have entered the market
    7. Stimulative monetary policy threatens to inflate the bubble even more (and tight policy to cause its popping)

3. The Top
This reflects a general principle: When things are so good that they can't get better -- yet everyone believes that they will get better -- tops of markets are being made.

While tops are triggered by different events, most often they occur when the central bank starts to tighten and interest rates rise.

A tightening of monetary policy in the currency in which debts are denominatd can be enough to cause foreign capital to pull back. This can happen for reasons unrelated to conditions in the domestic economy (e.g., cyclical conditiosn in a reservce currency country leads to a tighening in liquidity in that currency, or a financial crisis results in a pullback of capital, etc.). Also, a rise in the currency the debt is in relative to the currency incomes are in can cause an especially servere squeeze. (TODO: revisit)

The fastest rate of tightening typically comes about five months prior to the top of the stock market.

The increase in short-term interest rates makes holding cash more attractive, and it raises the interest rate used to discount the future cash flows of assets, weakening riskier asset prices and slowing lending.

To understand the magnitude of the downturn that is likely to occur, it is less important to understand each particular sector's sensitivity to tightening and how losses will cascade. These pictures are best seen by looking at each of the big players in these sectors rather than at economy-wide averages.

In the immediate postbubble period, the wealth effect of asset price movements has a bigger impact on economic growth rates than monetary policy does. People tend to underestimate the size of this effect. In the early stages of a bubble bursting, when stock prices fall and earnings have not yet declined, people mistakenly judge the decline to be a buying opportunity and find stocks cheap in relation to both past earnings and expected earnings, failing to account for the amount of decline in earnings that is likely to result from what's to come. But the reversal is self-reinforcing. As wealth falls first and incomes fall later, creditworthiness worsens, which constricts lending activity, which hurts spending and lowers investment rates while also making it less appealing to borrow to buy financial assets. This in turn worsens the fundamentals of the assest (e.g., the weaker economic activity leads corporate earnings to chronimcally disappoint), leading people to sell and driving down prices further. This has an accelerating downward impact on asset prices, income, and wealth.

4. The "Depression" (the severe contraction phase)
As the depression begins, debt defaults and restructurings hit the various players, especially leveraged lenders (e.g., banks), like an avalanche. Both lenders' and depositors' justified fears feed on themselves, leading to runs on financial institutions that typically don't have the cash to meet them unless they are under the umbrella of government protections.

With investors unwilling to continue lending and borrowers scrambling to find cash to cover their debt payments, liquidity -- i.e., the ability to sell investments for money -- becomes a major concern. The central bank either has to provide the liquidity that's needed by printing more money or allow a lot of defaults.

The depression can come from, or cause, either solvency problems or cash-flow problems. Usually a lot of both types of problems exist during this phase. A solvency problem means that, according to accounting and regulatory rules, the entity does not have enough equity capital to operate -- i.e., it is "broke" and must be shut down. So, the accounting laws have a big impact on the severity of the debt problem at this moment. A cash-flow problem means that an entity doesn't have enough cash to meet its needs, typically because its own lenders are taking money away from it -- i.e., there is a "run." A cash-flow problem can occur even when the entity has adequate capital because the equity is in illiquid assets. Lack of cash flow is an immediate and severe problem -- and as a result, the trigger and main issue of most debt crises.

Related to this, if the central bank produces more money to alleviate the shortage, it will cheapen the value of money, making a reality of creditors' worries about being paid back an amount of money that is worth less than what they loaned.

Most of what people think is money is really credit, and credit does appear out of thin air during good times and then disappear at bad times.

As this implies, a big part of the deleveraging process is people discovering that much of what they thought of as their wealth was merely people's promises to give them money.

If the write-down is 30 percent, then the creditor’s assets are reduced by that much. If that sounds like a lot, it’s actually much more. Since most lenders are leveraged (e.g., they borrow to buy assets), the impact of a 30 percent write-down on their net worth can be much greater. For example, the creditor who is leveraged 2:1 would experience a 60 percent decline in his net worth (i.e., their assets are twice their net worth, so the decline in asset value has twice the impact). Since banks are typically leveraged about 12:1 or 15:1, that picture is obviously devastating for them and for the economy as a whole.

#### Managing Depressions
Ignorance and a lack of authority are bigger problems than debts themselves. While being a successful investment manager is hard, it's not nearly as hard as being a successful economic policy maker.

##### Austerity
##### "Printing Money" to Stop the Bleeding and Stimulate the Economy
When risks emerget hat systemically important institutions will fail, policy makers must take steps to keep these entities running. They must act immediately to:
- Curtail panic and guarantee liabilities.
- Provide liquidity.
- Support the solvency of systemically important institutions.
- Recapitalize/nationalize/cover losses of systemically important financial institutions.

##### Debt Defaults/Restructurings
The best-managed cases are those in which policy makers 
- a. swiftly recognize the magnitude of the credit problems; 
- b. don't save every institution that is expendable, balancing the benefits of allowing broke institutions to fail and be restructured with the risks that such failures can have detrimental effects on other creditworthy lenders and borrowers; 
- c. create or restore robust credit pipes that allow for future borrowing by creditworthy borrowers; and 
- d. ensure acceptable growth and inflation conditions while the bad debts are being worked out.

There are relatively clear lines for which creditors receive protections:
- Small depositors are given preference and experience minimal or no losses (in nearly every case).
- In most cases when institutions fail, equity, subordinates debt, and large depositors absorb losses regardeless of whether the institution was systemically important or not. (TODO: revisit)
- Sometimes policy makers prioritize domestic creditors over foreign creditors, especially when their loans are to private sector players and are lower down in the capital structure. 

There are two main ways in which failed lenders' assets or existing lenders' bad assets are managed: They are either a. transferred to a seperate entity (an AMC) to manage the restructuring and asset disposal (about 40% of the cases studied) or b. they remain on the balance sheet of the original lending institution to manage (about 60% of cases). And there are several main levers for disposing of the nonperforming loans: a. restructuring (e.g., working out the loans through extended terms), b. debt-for-equity swaps and asset seizures, c. direct sales of the loans or assets to third parties, and d. securitizations.

##### Redistributing Wealth
Typically, increased taxation takes the form of greater income, property, and consumption taxes because these forms of taxation are the most effective at raising revenues. Wealth and inheritance taxes are sometimes also increased, though these typically raise very little money.

5. The "Beautiful Deleveraging"
A “beautiful deleveraging” happens when the four levers are moved in a balanced way so as to reduce intolerable shocks and produce positive growth with falling debt burdens and acceptable inflation.

The best way of negating the deflationary depression is for the central bank to provide adequate liquidity and credit support, and, depending on different key entities’ needs for capital, for the central government to provide that too.

The right amounts are those that a. neutralize what would otherwise be a deflationary credit market collapse and b. get the nominal growth rate marginally above the nominal interest rate to tolerably spread out the deleveraging process.

People ask if printing money will raise inflation. It won't if it offsets falling credit and the deflationary forces are balanced with this reflationary force. That's not a theory -- it's been repeatedly proven out in history. Remember, spending is what matters. A dollar of spending paid for with money has the same effect on prices as a dollar of spending paid for with credit. By "printing money," the central bank can make up for the disapperance of credit with an increase in the amount of money. This "printing" takes the form of central bank purchases of government securities and nongovernment assets such as corporate securities, equities, and other assets, which is reflected in money growing at an extremely fast rate at the same time as credit and real economic activity are contracting. What is happening at such times is that credit destruction is being offset by money creation. If the balance between replacing credit and actively stimulating the economy is right, this isn’t inflationary.

But there is such a thing as abusive use of stimulants. The key is to avoid printing too much money.

In the end, policy makers always print. That is because austerity causes more pain than benefit, big restructurings wipe out too much wealth too fast, and transfers of wealth from haves to have-nots don't happen in sufficient size without revolutions. Also, printing money is not inflationary if the size and character of the money creation offsets the size and character of the credit contraction. It is simply negating deflation.

6. "Pushing on a String"
- Monetary Policy 1 
Interest-rate driven monetary policy (which I’ll call Monetary Policy 1) is the most effective because it has the broadest impact on the economy.
- Monetary Policy 2 
“Quantitative easing” (QE) as it is now called (i.e., “printing money” and buying financial assets, typically debt assets), is Monetary Policy 2.
- Monetary Policy 3 
Monetary Policy 3 puts money more directly into the hands of spenders instead of investors/savers and incentivizes them to spend it.
    - An increase in debt-financed fiscal spending.
    - Increase in debt-financed fiscal spending, where the Treasury isn't on the hook for the debt
    - Not bothering to go through issuring debt, and instead giving newly printed money directly to the government to spend
    - Printing money and doing direct cash transfers to households (i.e., "helicopter money").
    - Big debt write-down accompanied by big money creation.

7. Normalization

### Inflationary Depressions and Currency Crises
If a currency falls in relation to another currency at a rate that is greater than the currency's interest rate, the holder of the debt in the weakening currency will lose money. If investors expect that weakness to continue without being compensated with higher interest rates, a dangerous currency dynamic will develop.

The currency dynamic is what produces inflationary depressions.

For now, suffice it to say that in times when money is flowing out of a currency, real interest rates need to rise less if real exchange rates fall more (and vise versa).

### The Phases of the Classic Inflationary Debt Cycle
1. The Early Part of the Cycle
Capital flows -- both within countries and among them -- are typically the most important flows to watch because they are the most volatile.

Foreign-exchange reserves are like savings: They can be used to bridge imbalances between the amount of currency demanded and the amount supplied by the free market in order to cushion the movements of the currency markets. They can also be used to purchase assets that might be desirable investments or offer strategic returns. The process of accumulating reserves is stimulative to the economy because it lessens the upward pressure on their own currency, which allows a country to maintain stronger export competitiveness and puts more money in the economy. Since central banks need to create more money to buy the foreign currency, doing that increases the amount of domestic currency funds to either buy assets (causing asset prices to rise) or lend out.

At this juncture, the currency's total return will be attractive because either a. those who want to buy what the country has to offer need to sell their own currency and buy the local currency or b. the central bank will increase the supply of its own currency and sell it for the foreign currency, which will make the country's assets go up when measured in its own currency. So, during this time when a country has a favorable balance of payments, there is a net inflow of money that leads to the currency appreciating and/or the foreign-exchange reserves increasing. This influx of money stimulates the economy and causes that country's markets to rise. Those invested in the country make money from the currency return (through a combination of currency price changes and asset return differences) and/or the asset appreciation. The more the currency appreciates, the less assets will appreciate.

2. The Bubble

During this stage, growth is increasingly financed by debt rather than productivity gains, and the country typically becomes highly reliant on foreign financing. This shows up in foreign currency denomiated debt rising.

During the bubble, the gap between the country's income and its spending widens. The country requires an increasing inflow of capital to drive continued growth in spending. But levels of economic activity can remain strong at the top of the cycle only as long as continued inflows, motivated by expectations of continued high growth, drive up asset prices and cause the currency to strengthen further. At this point, the country is increasingly fragile and even a minor event can trigger a reversal.

3. The Top and Currency Defense

This spiral sends the country into a balance of payments crisis and an inflationary depression.

Though worsening trade balances typically play a role (usually because of high currency level and excessive domestic consumption that led to high imports), adverse shifts in capital flows are usually more important.

There is a critical relationship between a. the interest rate difference and b. the spot/forward currency relationship.

Said differently, a managed currency decline accompanied by falling reserves causes the market to expect continued future currency depreciation, which pushes up domestic interest rates (as describe above), acting as a tightening at a time when the economy is already weak. Also, the expectation of continued devaluation will encourage increased capital withdrawals and devaluation speculation, widening the balance of payments gap and forcing the central bank to spend down more reserves to defend the currency (or abandon the planned gradual depreciation). Also, a currency defense by spending reservces will have to stop because no sensible policy maker will want to run out of such "savings." In such currency defenses, policy makers -- especially those defending a peg -- will typically make boldly confident statements vowing to stop the currency from weakening. All of these things classically happen just before the cycle moves to its next stage, which is letting the currency go.

4. The Depression (Often When the Currency Is Let Go)

Currency declines allow countries to offer price cuts to the rest of the world (helping to bring in more business) without producing domestic deflation.

5. Normalization

While this balance is partially made via trade adjustments, it is typically more determined by capital flows, so it primarily comes when the central bank succeeds in making it desireable to hold the currency again, and secondarily when spending and imports have fallen sufficiently to bring about an adjustment in the balance of payments.

While most people, including most policy makers, think that the best thing they can do is defend the currency during the currency defense phase, actually the opposite is true, because a currency level a. that is good for the trade balance, b. that produces a positive total return, and that c. has an interest rate that is appropriate for domestic conditions, is a low one.

As explained earlier, the best way to bring that about is to let the currency depreciate sharply and quickly. In other words, the best way to ensure that investors expect positive total returns going forward at a relatively low real interest rate (which is what the weak domestic conditions need) is to depreciate the currency enough.11 Both the balance

##### The Spiral from a More Transitory Inflationary Depression to Hyperinflation
The most important characteristic of cases that spiral into hyperinflations is that policy makers don't close the imbalance between external income, external spending, and debt service, and keep funding external spending over sustained periods of time by printing lots of money. In some cases, it's not voluntary.

As stated earlier, contrary to popular belief, it's not as easy to stop printing money during a crisis. Stopping printing when capital is flowing out can cause an extreme tightness of liquidity and often a deep economic contraction. And the longer the crisis goes on, the harder it becomes to stop printing money.

###### How the Spiral Plays Out
With each round of printing, more of the printed money is transferred to real or foreign assets instead of being spent on goods and services that fuel economic activity.

Because much of the country's debt is denominated in a foreign currency, debt burdens rise when the currency falls, which requires spending cuts and asset sales.

Foreign lenders just care about the rate of change in the currency relative to the interest rate change. (TODO) So for policy makers hoping to stabilize the balance of payments, inflation is a secondary consideration compared to ensuring that there are positive expected returns for saving in that currency. They have to get the currency cheap enough so that it, with the desired interest rate, will produce a positive return.

a. Cooperative-competitive relationships
b. Mutually threatening relationships

When investors hold a lot of promises to deliver currency (i.e., a lot of debt denominated in a currency) and the supply of that currency is tied to something that backs it, the ability of the central bank to produce currency is limited. (TODO)

## PART 2: Detailed Case Studies

### German Debt Crisis and Hyperinflation (1918-1924)

### US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (1928-1937)

Classically, in a balance of payments crisis, interest rate increases large enough to adequately compensate holders of debt in weak currency for the currency risk are way too large to be tolerated by the domestic economy, so they don't work. (TODO)

By the way, politicians and policy makers frequently make disingenuous promises that are expedient and inconsistent with economic and market fundamentals, and such promises should never be believed.

Within two weeks of leaving the gold peg, the Federal Reserve was able to decrease its liquidity injections; short-term rates decreased by one percent to two percent, bankers' acceptance rates dropped back to two percent, and call loan rates decreased to three percent. The money supply increased by 1.5 percent over the next three months, and the Dow as up by almost 100 percent over the next four months. These moves ended the depression on a dime. (TODO)

### US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

During the bubble, there were five key components that helped fuel leveraging outside the traditional banking system:
1. Use of repo agreements and commercial paper.
2. Large institutional depositors outside the protected banking system.
3. Development of money market funds, a short-term savings vehicle which promoised higher returns than bank accounts without much additional risk.
4. Globalization of dollar lending, leading to the explosion of dollar borrowing and lending outside of US banks.
5. Securitization of lending, where banks take their traditional loans (auto loans, home loans, etc.) and sell them to other investors.

Borrowers and lenders had severe asset/liability mismatches, which left them especially vulnerable in a downturn. This is a classic ingredeint of a severe debt crisis. Most commonly these mismatches come in the following forms:
1. Borrowing short-term and lending long-term, leaving them to be squeezed when those who lent to them short-term don't want to lend to them anymore or only want to lend to them at interest rates much higher than what they are earning on the loans they have already made.
2. Lending to risky borrowers who will pay higher interest rates than they borrowed at in order to collect the credit spread -- until the default rates pick up to a level greater than the credit spread.
3. Borrowing in one currency and lending/investing in another. When the currency they borrowed in rises, it forces borrowers to pay back the loan at a higher exchange rate or a higher interest rate than they can manage.
