## Day 5 Seeing Life from God's View

We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are. 

How you define life determines your destiny. Your perspective will influence how you invest your tiem, spend your money, use your talents, and value your relationships. 

Your unspoken life metaphore influences your life more than you realize. It determins your expectations, your values, your relationships, your goals, and your priorities. 

Life is a _test_, life is a _trust_, and life is a _temporary assignment_. 

### Life on earth as a Test. 
Character is both developed and revealed by tests, and _all_ of life is a test. 

You will be tested by major changes, delayed promises, impossible problems, unanswered prayers, undeserved criticism, and even senseless tragedies. In my own life I have noticed that God tests my _faith_ through problems, tests my _hope_ by how I handle possessions, and tests my _love_ through people. 

A very important test is how you act whne you can't _feel_ God's presense in your life. Sometimes God intentionally draws back, and we don't sense his closeness.

Hezekiah had enjoyed a close fellowship with God, but at a crutial point in his life God left him alone to test his character, to reveal a weakness, and to prepare him for more responsibility. 

When you understand that life is a test, you realize that _nothing_ is insignificant in your life. Even the smallest incident has significance for your character development. _Every_ day is an importatnt day, and every second is a growth opportunity to deepen your character, to demonstrate love, or to depend on God. Some tests seem overwhelming, while others you don't even notice. But all of them have eternal implications. 

### Life on earth is a Trust. 
This concept of stewardship begins with the recognition that God is the owener of everything and everyone on earth. The Bible says, "_The world and all that is in it belong to the LORD; the earth and all who live on it are his._"

"_Those who are trusted with something valuable must show they are worthy of that trust._"

If you treat everything as a _trust_, God promises three rewards in eternity. First, you will be given God's _affirmation_: He will say, "Good job! Well done!" Next, you will receive a _promotion_ and be given greater responsibility in eternity: "I will put you in charge of many things." Then you will be honored with a _celebration_: "Come and shsare your Master's happiness."

**Verse to Remember**: "unless you are faithful in small matters, you won't be faithful in larger ones." Luke 16:10a (NLT)
